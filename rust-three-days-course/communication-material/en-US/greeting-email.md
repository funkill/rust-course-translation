Hello,

I'm looking forward to seeing you soon at our Rust course.

We will spend three days with learning the programming language and getting a bearing of the world around it. Rust is a complex programming language - we will not be able to cover every corner. This is why the course will focus on good and secure base knowledge. There is - however - time allocated to discuss complex questions.

You will probably have expectations for the course and have several questions that are pressing to you. I'm looking forward to seeing what that is.

For that reason, I would like you to prepare the following questions ahead of the course:

* What do you want to use Rust for?
* Which are the questions that you've always been interested in?
* If you already worked with Rust: what was the hardest part for you?
* With which of the following languages do you identify most?
  - C/C++
  - Objective-C/Swift
  - Haskell/ML
  - Ruby/Python/Perl/Java
  
We will discuss these questions at the beginning of the course within our group. This will help us to be better able to discuss relevant issues with you over the days.

Finally, I'd like to encourage you to communicate your questions and wishes as early as possible. I do not always have everything present along with an example. The more time I have, the better I can find a good answer.
